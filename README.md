* This is my work alongside [Sophia Wanjiku](https://github.com/sophiewanjiku) as part of Luna Hacks 2.0 held at Kabarak University. This repo contains the software track of the hackathon whereby we did;

         * Mental Health Chatbot 
         * Sudoku Solver
         
# Sudoku Solver
* The sudoku solver is a fun game done in golang. It allows the user try to solve a sudoku puzzle based on the level of their skill whether easy, medium or difficult. In the case of inability to solve the puzzle, the user gets to decide whether or not they would like the program to sove the puzzle through the sudoku solver or if they would like to try again. The game aims at just having fun and relive stress.



# Mental Health Chatbot
* `End goal`: develop a chatbot using machine learning that can provide mental health support to people in Kenya. The chatbot should be able to detect and analyze the user's messages and provide appropriate responses and resources, including information on mental health disorders, coping mechanisms, and professional help. Use a dataset of mental health conversations collected from various sources, including online forums, support groups, and counseling sessions. The dataset should be preprocessed to remove any identifying information and annotated with relevant labels, such as emotions and mental health disorders. They can also use existing resources, such as the Kenya Ministry of Health's Mental Health Policy and the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme, to inform their chatbot's responses and resources.
